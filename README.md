# ASP.NET 6 MVC Labs 
## Former Course 20486D from MS Learning

Course **20486D: Developing ASP.NET Core MVC Applications** was a course from MS Learning, retired on 2021/12/30. The course covered ASP.NET MVC in the .NET Core 2.1 timeframe (2018) 

Some of the course material (the training textbook, the slides) was **not** Open Sourced. 

But all demos, lab solutions and build instructions (with the detailed steps) was Open Sourced on Github, using the very permissive MIT License.

This fork is updating demos and labs to the latest .NET version: .NET 6.

**Important note** : This solution uses a default branch named `net6`.  

The original branch (named `master`), is still using .NET 2.1.

All demos and labs are now updated from 2.1 to .NET 6. A minimum rewrite was done in this first release. A future release should rewrite and re-architecture the source code. (For example, modern apps should not have a dependency on jQuery.)  

---

### Todo

Lab instructions are still using .NET 2.1 and VS 2017. All steps should be updated to supprt.NET 6 and VS 2022.
